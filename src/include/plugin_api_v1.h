/*
 * Schwung Plugin API v1
 *
 * Stable ABI for DSP modules loaded by the host runtime.
 * Modules are .so files loaded via dlopen() and must export move_plugin_init_v1().
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THREADING CONTRACT — READ THIS FIRST
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * THERE IS NO CONTROL THREAD. Every entry point below runs on the SPI audio
 * callback: SCHED_FIFO 90, pinned to core 3, with roughly 900 microseconds of
 * budget per 128-frame block after the ~2 ms transfer.
 *
 *      create_instance     <- yes, this one too
 *      destroy_instance
 *      set_param           <- yes, this one too
 *      get_param           <- yes, this one too
 *      on_midi / process_midi
 *      render_block / process_block / tick
 *
 * This is the single most misunderstood thing about writing a Schwung module.
 * A 2026-08 audit of all 113 catalogued modules found ~150 confirmed realtime
 * violations, and several carried comments asserting the opposite in so many
 * words — "control-thread only (blocking dir + file I/O)", "run on the control
 * thread, NEVER from process_block, so this malloc is realtime-safe", "safe
 * because it runs in the MIDI callback (not the RT render thread)". Every one
 * of those premises is false, and each produced a multi-megabyte blocking
 * operation on the audio thread. If you take one thing from this header, take
 * this paragraph.
 *
 * FORBIDDEN in all of the calls listed above:
 *
 *   - file I/O: fopen/fread/fwrite/open/read/stat/opendir/readdir/mkdir/unlink
 *   - allocation or free: malloc/calloc/realloc/free/new/delete
 *   - locks held by any non-RT thread (and any lock without PRIO_INHERIT)
 *   - fork/exec/system/popen, dlopen
 *   - logging of any kind, including host->log and a bare fprintf(stderr, ...)
 *     -- stderr is unbuffered, so that is a write() syscall even when your
 *     debug flag is off
 *   - unbounded work: an FFT, a full-buffer memset, a directory sort
 *
 * The symptom is not a glitch in your module. It is a device-wide audio
 * dropout, because you are holding the thread that services every other
 * module's audio and Move's own.
 *
 * THREADS INHERIT SCHED_FIFO 90. pthread_create() called from any of the
 * above hands your worker the callback's realtime priority. Move's own
 * `Link Main` thread runs at SCHED_FIFO 35, so an inherited-priority worker
 * starves Move's audio publisher and produces exactly the dropouts you were
 * trying to avoid by going off-thread. Every worker must demote itself as its
 * FIRST action:
 *
 *      struct sched_param sp = { .sched_priority = 0 };
 *      sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_OTHER, &sp);
 *      // and keep core 3 free for SPI:
 *      cpu_set_t set; CPU_ZERO(&set);
 *      CPU_SET(0, &set); CPU_SET(1, &set); CPU_SET(2, &set);
 *      sched_setaffinity(0, sizeof(set), &set);
 *
 * Reference implementations that get this right: schwung-keydetect
 * (keyfinder_wrapper.cpp -- demotes and pins) and schwung-airwindows
 * (clap_fx.cpp loader_thread_fn -- demotes, with a comment naming the
 * inheritance problem). The audit found at least 14 modules that do not.
 *
 * WHAT TO DO INSTEAD. Load files, allocate buffers and build lists on your own
 * SCHED_OTHER worker thread, and have the audio path pick up the result by
 * publishing a pointer. Keep get_param cheap: a `get_param` that rescans a
 * directory is served on this thread once per repaint, not once per click.
 * If you must do work at create time, prefer doing it lazily on the worker and
 * rendering silence until it lands.
 *
 * See docs/REALTIME_SAFETY.md for the measurements behind all of this.

     * can happen. It isn't: a module's copy of this header can declare a field
     * we do not have, and the guard then tests memory belonging to somebody
     * else.
     *
     * That is not hypothetical. breakbeat's copy appends
     * `float (*get_project_bpm)(void)` after get_beat_position -- a callback
     * NO Schwung has ever provided -- so it resolves to +120, one past our
     * last field. Its own comment reads "Appended host callbacks. Keep these
     * at the end for ABI compatibility", which is the right instinct applied
     * in the wrong direction: appending lets a module be OLDER than the host,
     * never newer. A module cannot extend this struct from its side.
     *
     * The same binary calls the real get_bpm() at +88, so the two offsets sit
     * side by side in one disassembly. The struct a chain sub-plugin gets is
     * chain_instance_t::subplugin_host_api, so +120 read the NEXT MEMBER of
     * that instance — non-NULL, so the module's own guard passed, and the blr
     * jumped into the heap. SIGSEGV on the SPI callback at load, which takes
     * MoveOriginal down with it and boot-loops the device if the slot is
     * restored.
     *
     * Zeroed by construction: every instance of this struct is a static or a
     * member of a calloc'd instance, and chain_host memcpy's sizeof(). So an
     * over-read by up to 64 bytes finds NULL and the caller's existing guard
     * does what it was always written to do.
     *
     * This does NOT make the ABI extensible. Appending a real field still
     * requires modules to be rebuilt; the reserved run only buys a safe
     * failure instead of a crash. Shrink it and old binaries start reaching
     * past it again — so consume from the FRONT when adding a field, and
